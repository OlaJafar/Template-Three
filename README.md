# My Third HTML & CSS Project - Template Three

This is the third template I have built to practice my **HTML** and **CSS** skills. It is a multi-section web page designed to practice layout building and modern CSS techniques.

### 🔗 Live Demo
You can see the project live here: [Template Three](https://olajafar.github.io/Template-Three/)

## What I Practiced in this Template:
* **Advanced Layouts:** Using Flexbox and CSS Grid to organize content.
* **Custom Variables:** Using CSS variables (like `--main-color`) to make the code cleaner.
* **Hover Effects:** Adding smooth animations and transitions when hovering over items.
* **Responsive Design:** Making sure the website looks good on different screen sizes.
* **Pseudo-elements:** Using `::before` and `::after` for creative designs.

## Built With:
* HTML5
* CSS3 (Custom Properties, Flexbox, Grid)
* Font Awesome (for icons)
* Google Fonts (Cairo & Open Sans)

## Project Goals:
1. To practice building more complex sections.
2. To improve my skills in CSS animations and transitions.
3. To learn how to structure a large HTML file correctly.
